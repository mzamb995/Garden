#  Understanding Your Ideas

1. First, establish if you already have a pre-existing research question or you are trying to generate a specific question from a broad question (i.e. For patients with a history of heart attacks, is aspirin more effective than other antiplatelet aggregators in preventing further heart attacks?)
2. Once you have arrived at your research question it can help to break it down into concepts, typically you want 2 or 3 (not many more) distinct essential concepts.
	1. Problem (Heart Attacks)
	2. Patient 
	3. Intervention (Aspirin)
3. For each concept collect different terminology
	1. Including regular text words
	2. Controlled vocabulary (MeSH)

| Concept              | Text Words   | Controlled Vocabulary |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| ==Problem==:Heart attack | `Heart attack`<br>`Heart attacks`<br>`myocardial infarct`<br>`myocardial infarcts`<br>`myocardial infarction`<br>`myocardial infarctions`<br>`MI`<br>`AMI`<br>`heart infarct`<br>`heart infarcts`<br>`heart infarction`<br>`heart infarctions`<br> | `myocardial infarction`                      |
| ==Intervention==: Aspirin                     | `aspirin`<br>`acetylsalicylic acid`<br>`acetyl salicylic acid`<br>`ASA`             | `aspirin`                      |
4. After we have our basic concepts and associated terms we need to develop a search structure using boolean operators.
