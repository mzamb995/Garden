#Busqueda 

This will limit your results to a particular category of publications

Typically, when carrying out a systematic review, we want to avoid using the built-in database filters as they pose risks of bias and error. 

They can be very useful when custom-made and intentionally designed as they look for 
- Study design type
- Topic focus
- Other research features

## What does a filter look like? 

This is an example of a filter that works on PubMed that has been validated and works to find randomized control trials

1. "randomized controlled trial"[pt]
2. "controlled clinical trial"[pt]
3. randomized[tiab]
4. placebo [tiab]
5. "drug therapy"[sh]
6. randomly[tiab]
7. trial[tiab]
8. groups[tiab]
9.  #1 OR #2 OR #3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6 OR #7 OR #8 
10. animals [mh] NOT humans [mh]
11. #9 NOT #10
