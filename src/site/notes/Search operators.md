#Busqueda 

These are the most essential building blocks that will connect our words and key concepts and specify what logical relationships they have with one another

## These should be used in ALL CAPS unless your database specifies it

1. OR (finds results with ANY term)
	1. Use to connect ==similar terms
2. AND (finds results with ALL terms)
	1. Use to connect ==different concepts
3. Parentheses()
	1. Use to group search terms into a logical set
		1. A logical set is a collection of different words that represent a distinct category of concepts
4. Double quotation marks"" (finds terms in same order and no other words between)
	1. Use to search for a precise search (This one works on most search engines, including Google!)
5. Truncation (different endings of a word stem) 
	1. This can vary between databases and sometimes 

### Examples
1. OR
* heart attack **OR** myocardial infarction (synomyms)
* heart attack **OR** myocardial ischemia 
2. AND
* heart attack **AND** aspirin
3. () 
* Combine one logical set with a different set
	* (heart attack OR myocardial isquemia) AND (aspirin OR ASA)
4. ""
* "Stem cell transplantation"
