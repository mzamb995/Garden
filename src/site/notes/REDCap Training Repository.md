#REDcap 

## The following are some resources that I found while trying to train myself on REDCap from Zero

I thought it might be more efficient to start to compile them here in case others after me want a one-stop-shop to free online resources. This is a work-in-progress and I am by no means an expert, but I will update this page with my findings in the hope that someone else will be able to save themselves some time and avoid having to dig around the web.

There wasn't a particular order that I utilized these resources, I looked through them to answer questions as they came up during survey creation. I think the ITHS REDCap Training Series is a good starting point for learners with some programming experience. If you are completely new, then the [Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/clinical-data-management#modules) could be a good ramp into the more advanced concepts or this [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08GJAteTFcg). 

For answering specific questions about advanced features I frequently used YouTube to find more information about these features.

### YouTube Channels or Playlists 
These are some YouTube channels that helped me answer more advanced questions 

- [ UCD REDCap](https://www.youtube.com/@ucdredcap5650/videos)
	- Nice channel with varied videos, a bit outdated and not as updated as I would like, but the videos are friendly, bite sized pieces of information covering the most important aspects of REDCap and some advanced features

- [UArizona Health Sciences REDCap](https://www.youtube.com/@cb2redcap)
	- This channel is my go-to resource nowadays, frequently updated, and they cover a vast array of topics. 
	- If I could fault them of one thing: Their videos are not short at all, get your tea and popcorn ready, every video is a movie, packed with great info! Definitely better if you are looking to deepen your understanding of a specific tool or feature, perhaps not so great as a general overview
	-  They have a lengthy lecture for:
		- [Beginners ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GZM1U_LB3g)
		- [Intermediate learners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clyVnigkhpM)
		- [Advanced learners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zftXvMp34gA)

- [REDCap for VCU](https://www.youtube.com/@redcapforvcu/videos)
	- Bite sized videos covering advanced concepts
	- Was a useful channel when trying to answer specific questions in a short period of time

- [Research Informatics](https://www.youtube.com/@researchinformatics1635/videos)
	- Great Introduction[ lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08GJAteTFcg)
	- Few videos but all very user friendly and engaging


### Useful Concepts & Tools 
The most challenging aspect of REDCap in my case was learning about new tools and features, to truly get the most value I feel that learning about these is essential.
Some of these have individual videos for each one, if I have time I want to make a separate page for each concept with specific videos and material for each one (because a whole article could be written on each one) and demos of how it can be useful. 
Just know for now that it is important to consider if these are things that could make your project better, because when I started I didn't even realize some of these could be done
- Branching logic (conditional logic)
- Smart tags
- Action tags
	- Inline tag to display PDF or Pictures to participants
- Piping
- Automated Survey alerts & Invitations
- Data quality assessment tool (sidebar on left)
- API Keys
- Report building
- Data dictionary export/import
- Survey Queue
- Survey color customization
- Repeating Instruments (This was the aspect that gave me the most trouble)
- Longitudinal instruments (not the same as repeating, although not mutually exclusive)
