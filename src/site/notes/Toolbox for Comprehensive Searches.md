**Tools to Get Better Search Terms:** 

[MeSH Re: Miner](https://hgserver2.amc.nl/cgi-bin/miner/miner2.cgi) This Resource will look through your PubMed Query and identify the frequency with which certain terms appear, allowing you to carry out an iterative process and be able to bolster your search and identify both controlled and non-controlled terms that could aid your search. 

[The University of Newcastle](https://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/rstoolkit/find-searchstrategy) has put together a basic toolkit enumerating the different steps to a systematic review and they have a good page on the general steps of how to develop an effective search strategy

[MeSH on Demand](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/MeSHonDemand) This resources allows researchers to paste in an abstract or manuscript and it will process the text to produce out potential key terms. The ideal use case would be to find an article that you feel is important to your topic and paste that abstract into this tool. 

[Systematic Review Accelerator](https://sr-accelerator.com/#/wordfreq) This is a fantastic toolkit for Systematic Review Development by Bond University, AU, it contains a:
- Word Frequency tool that will analyze exported library files from Zotero and give an analysis of the most frequent to least frequent terms
- Search Refinery tool where one can put in the query that has been sent to PubMed and it will attempt to refine it to add or remove terms that could be getting in the way
- Polyglot Search which will translate a search query to the PubMed database into other databases such as Scopus, WoS, etc. 

Additional AI models, such as [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#capabilities), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/?sso=)) can also be used by giving them an abstract and asking the model to suggest relevant terms to expand your search.

**Tools to find additional papers or to search for other "pearl" papers:** 

[Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.com/): This is one of my favorite tools as it is simple to use, it just requires one article that you think fits in your search, it will graph out who has cited that paper and what papers it cited and give the most relevant papers which can sometimes reveal new "Pearl" papers that will give you more interesting and related papers. 

[CitationChaser](https://estech.shinyapps.io/citationchaser/): An Rstudio application that also has a web-based online interface, that performs Backwords and Forwards citation chasing and gives a comprehensive list of relevant articles and it can even de-duplicate comparing what it found between the forward and backward citation chasing. This can be used at any point in a systematic review, at the start to gather more pearls, but it can also be utilized near the end of the review to attempt to find more relevant literature.
