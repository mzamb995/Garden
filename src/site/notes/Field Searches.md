#Busqueda 
Every database divides the article up into smaller parts that we can think of as =="fields"==

1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Keywords
4. Other Attributes

## A field code instructs the search engine to only look within a specific field

This could be useful if you want to make sure a term is within the title and the abstract
Our searches may initially not utilize this method, but it can be a great way to quickly get articles that have to do with the subject matter

### Examples

Add a tag:

heart  `[ti]` 
	This will only search for the word heart in the title field of the article
