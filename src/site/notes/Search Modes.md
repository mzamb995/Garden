#Busqueda 

Two main ways of searching
1. **Text word search**
	1. This will search for the words you give in the title, abstract or other elements of the text.
2. **Controlled vocabulary search**
	3. Will search for specific words that someone else has assigned to the article you are reading, this will work well in articles that have already been reviewed, but if the person that reviewed it has missed a term you could miss a valuable article.
	4. MeSH terms (can be found in the MeSH [database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh))
	5. Other databases may utilize different controlled vocabulary as MeSH is specific to PubMed


Both modes should be used for a comprehensive search.
